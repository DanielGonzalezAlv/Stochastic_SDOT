\TODO{Motivation for Optimal Transport \& recall some definitions from measure theory}
%    We recall some definitions and results from measure theory. 
%    \bigskip
    
    %
    \noindent Let $(X, \A)$ be a measurable space and $\mu, \tilde \mu$ measures on $X$.  We say that $\mu$ is absolutely continuous with respect to $\tilde \mu$, if
    %if every set with measure zero with respect to $\tilde \mu$ has measure zero with respect to $\mu$. This means 
    \[\tilde \mu(A) = 0 \Rightarrow \mu(A) = 0 \quad \quad  \forall A\in \A. \]
    and denote this by $\mu \ll \tilde \mu$.
    %
    Let $(X, \A, \mu)$ be a measure space and $(Y, \U)$ a measurable space. For a measurable function $T: X \to Y $, 
    we denote by $T_{\#}\mu$ the pushforward measure on $Y$ induced by $T$, i.e
    \[T_{\#}\mu(B) = \mu(T^{-1}(B)) \quad \quad \forall B \in \U. \]
    %
%    \noindent As $S$ is a finite set, we can write $S = \{s_1,\dots s_{|S|} \}$ and $\nu$ as a finite sum of dirac measures
%    \[\nu = \sum_{i = 1}^{|S|} {\nu_i \delta_{s_i}} \quad \text{such that} \quad \sum_{i=1}^{|S|}{\nu_i} = 1.  \]
